    <h1>Readymade UI</h1>

    <div>
      <p>
        Readymade UI is a specialized user-interface library for remote control
        surfaces. Designed primarily for touch surfaces, Readymade UI is built
        with web specifications, making them portable wherever browsers are
        available. Many Readymade UI elements can participate in HTML forms,
        however their real power is unlocked when using the elements as a remote
        control. Every Readymade UI element can dispatch events to a global
        event bus that can then transmit events over Touch OSC, WebSocket, or
        WebRTC.

      <h2>Elements</h2>

      <p>
        Examples of each Readymade UI element are below. Open DevTools console
        to observe messages dispatched from each element.

      <div>
        <rd-radiogroup class="form__item">
          <input type="radio" name="control" value="form" />
          <label for="form">Form</label>
          <input type="radio" name="control" value="channel" checked />
          <label for="channel">Channel</label>
        </rd-radiogroup>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Surface</h2>

    <p>
      Readymade UI elements can be attached to a control surface named
      RdSurface. The rd-surface element provides an interface for laying out a
      control surface comprised of Readymade UI elements. The above
      documentation is displayed on an instance of RdSurface that is configured
      to display with CSS Grid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below is another example of using RdSurface to layout a video game
      controller using CSS Grid in a more complex layout.
