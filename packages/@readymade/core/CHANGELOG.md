# CHANGELOG

## 2.0.0-beta.0

- NEW set Shadow DOM mode to 'open' or 'closed' in Component Decorator
- NEW `$state` property exposes component state, use `getState()` (or whatever method is bound to `State`) as a best practice
- NEW development and testing environment 
- FIX performance issues
- FIX issues with state when custom elements are dynamically added to DOM


BREAKING CHANGES

State will no longer automatically update after changing properties on the Component class. While this approach was convenient, it is much more performant not to track instances of the class but rather instances of state. State is now exposed as this.$state or by the getter used when declaring the @State decorator.

Several internal APIs were shifted around. Private APIs are prexied with `Éµ`. Public APIs are exposed with `$`. 

## 1.2.0

- FIX performance improvements
- REMOVE check for `no-attr` attribute, make check automatic for non applicable attributes during change detection


## 1.1.2

- FIX automatic call to `customElements.define` should be opt out


## 1.1.1

- FIX issue that caused array values to not correctly update in some use cases
- ADD check for `no-attr` attribute on Elements to forego expensive change detection on attributes where not applicable


## 1.1.0

### BREAKING CHANGES

This release introduces improvements to the Component interface and internal state. These changes may effect your usage of Readymade. Please read the following to understand how to update components built with Readymade.

- ADD automatic call to `customElements.define` in Component decorator
- ADD `setState` now accepts string using dot, braket syntax to update deep values
- FIX issues when updating state that is an Object
- FIX issues with updating state

Manual calls to `customElements.define` are no longer required. Readymade will automatically call `customElements.define` using the `selector` property in the `@Component` decorator.

To update to `1.1.0`:

`npm install @readymade/core@^1.1.0`
`yarn upgrade @readymade/core@^1.1.0`

For autonomous custom elements:

1. Ensure the element has a `selector` defined in the `@Component` decorator.
2. Remove any call to `customElements.define` in your code.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'x-atom',
  style: css`
      :host {
        display: flex;
      }
	`,
  template: html`
    <span>{{state}}</span>
	`,
})
class AtomComponent extends CustomElement {
```

For customized built-in elements:

1. Ensure the element has a `selector` defined in the `@Component` decorator.
2. Ensure the element has a `custom` property defined in the `@Component` decorator.
3. Remove any call to `customElements.define` in your code.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-button',
  custom: { extends: 'button'},
  style: css`
		:host {
			cursor: pointer;
		}
	`,
  template: html`
   <span>{{model}}</span>
	`,
})
class MyButtonComponent extends ButtonComponent {
```

### IMPROVEMENTS

This release also fixes several issues when working with internal state.

Now its possible to define properties on state as Objects and Arrays.

```typescript
export class TreeState {
  public arrayModel = ['Node 1', 'Node 2', 'Node 3', 'Node 4', 'Node 5', 'Node 6', 'Node 7'];
  public objectModel = {
    foo: {
      bar: {
        baz: 'bbb',
      },
    },
  };
}
```

After binding to state with the `@State` decorator...

```typescript
@State()
public getState() {
  return new TreeState();
}
```

reference objects and arrays in the component's template

```html
<x-node model="{{objectModel.foo.bar.baz}}"></x-node>
<x-node model="{{arrayModel[0]}}"></x-node>
```

and update deeply nested objects with `setState`.

```typescript
 this.setState('objectModel.foo.bar', { baz: 'foo' } );
```

This represents a substantial improvement over the state mechanisms introduced in 1.0.0.
