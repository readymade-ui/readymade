### Development

This repo includes a development server built with Parcel.

Fork and clone the repo. Install dependencies with yarn.

```
yarn install
```

To develop, run `yarn dev`. This will spin up a local Parcel development server at http://localhost:4444.

Available routes are specified in src/client/app/router.ts.

For unit and e2e tests, run `yarn build` then `yarn test`.

Use `yarn test:open` to open a GUI and run tests interactively.

### Production

To build the library for production, i.e. to use as a local dependency in another project run `yarn build:lib`.
