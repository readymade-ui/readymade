### Getting Started

Install Readymade:

```

```
npm install @readymade/dom
```

If you want to use the client-side router:

```
npm install @readymade/router
```

For the UI library:

### Development

This repo includes a development server built with Vite.

Fork and clone the repo. Install dependencies with yarn.

```
yarn install
```

To develop, run `yarn start`. This will spin up a Vite development server at http://localhost:4443.

For working on the documentation portal use `yarn start:client`.

Production is built with `yarn build`. This will generate a client and server that can be deployed.

For unit and e2e tests, run `yarn build` then `yarn test`.

Use `yarn test:open` to open a GUI and run tests interactively.

### Production

To build the library for production, i.e. to use as a local dependency in another project run `yarn build:library`.
